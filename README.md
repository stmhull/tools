Stuff I got sick of typing or googling

### awsh
So I didn't have to keep remembering how to SSH into our EC2 instance, what the IP is, etc

### sdate
simple date. the date utility has too many edge cases I usually don't care about, and there are annoying differences between linux and osx. this takes a date in the form of YYYY-MM-DD and spits out the epoch number, and vice versa.
